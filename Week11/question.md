[1] Why in [https://2021.help.altair.com/2021/hwsolvers/rad/topics/solvers/rad/theory_material_laws_viscous_materials_gen_maxwell_kelvin_model_visco_mat_r.htm],:

Shear behavior is computed using a shear factor as:

$$
\mathrm{G}(t)=\mathrm{G}_{\infty}+\sum_1^5 G_i e^{-\beta_i t}
$$

The sum is from 1 to 5, is the elastic branch encounted?

[2] in [https://help.solidworks.com/2012/english/solidworks/cworks/Generalized_Maxwell_Model.htm], what is $g_i$?
