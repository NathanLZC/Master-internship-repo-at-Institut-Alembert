# Master Thesis Project

## Fluage et surfaces rugueuses : évolution du contact entre matériaux viscoélastiques

A brief description of your thesis project goes here. Explain the problem you're addressing, the hypothesis or research questions you're exploring, and the significance of your work.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. Since you mentioned Python version, let's specify that:

```bash

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Say what the step will be, for example:

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanLZC/Master-internship-repo-at-Institut-dAlembert
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd Master-internship-repo-at-Institut-dAlembert
```

3. **Install the required packages**

Make sure you have `pip` installed and then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` file.
