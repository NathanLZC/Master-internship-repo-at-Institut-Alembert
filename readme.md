## Fluage et surfaces rugueuses : évolution du contact entre matériaux viscoélastiques

We are aiming to design a solver for evolution of the contact between two random rough viscoelastic surfaces. If possible, we want to continue developing with wavelet method. This repo records our development workflow.

### Key word: FFT, Boundary element method, Viscoelastic, contact mechanics

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is mainly based on Python and C++, the notebooks in */Weekn* contain theory background for contact mechanics. The python version is:

```bash
Python 3.10.6 64-bit
```

### Installing

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanLZC/Master-internship-repo-at-Institut-dAlembert
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd Master-internship-repo-at-Institut-dAlembert
```

3. **Install the required packages**

Make sure you have `pip` installed and then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

### For .py and .ipynb files, we strongly recommand to use VS code.
### For .cc/.cpp files, we rely on Makefile and CMake


## Requirement libraries
### FFTW



## Streamlit


## Built With
