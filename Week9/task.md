[1] Using the same random surface to compare the result from Python and C++ with algorithm1

[2] Fix algorithm2.py(error decreases problem), implement in C++, check in particular the contact area and the maximum pressure

"For reference, I tried a test case with R = 1, mean pressure = 1e-2, system of size L = 1, 300x300 discretization, and the error is lower than 1e-12 after 42 iterations with the Polonsky--Keer algorithm."
