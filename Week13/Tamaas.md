We plan to contribute our solver to open-source Tamaas project(https://tamaas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by creating merge requests(https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html#new-merge-request-from-a-fork).

We can start to learn how to play with git, especially how to merge branches, we have installed GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/). 

We also installed blender, we will try to learn this rendering skill as well.
