We plan to contribute our solver to open-source Tamaas project(https://tamaas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by creating merge requests(https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html#new-merge-request-from-a-fork).

We can start to learn how to play with git, especially how to merge branches, we have installed GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/editor_extensions/visual_studio_code/). 

We also installed blender, we will try to learn this rendering skill as well.

To initiate our work on GitLab, we follow the steps in [3]. We have been added in Tamaas project as developer, so we plan to play with our branch.

When we talk about git, we should be clear with local and remote repo, for Gitlab, we can easily create a New branch by clicking
