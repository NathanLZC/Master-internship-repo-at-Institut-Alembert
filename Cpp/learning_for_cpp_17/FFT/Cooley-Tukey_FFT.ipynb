    "However, the complexity of DFT is $O\\left(N^2\\right)$, which limits its computation capacity. In 1965, James Cooley and John Tukey developped *Fast Fourier transform*, which has a complexity of $N \\times \\log _2(N)$. Before this, Danielson and Lanczos has started their discussion that any DTF can be rewroten to be the sum of two DFT.\n",
