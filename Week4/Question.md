I want to add C++ now, there could be more attemptions that could output excutable files with less use, is any gitignore file necessary?

p.s. I get used to use bash mode for compiling, but debuging with vs code could be interesting, a little bit configuration has started in .vscode file folder.

I learned C++ 98, any advise for version? Let's have a look at .vscode file folder.
