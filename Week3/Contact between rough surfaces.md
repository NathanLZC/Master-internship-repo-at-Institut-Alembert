# Study plan for Contact between rough surfaces


## Problem mapping

Here we cite documents in CMET 2024 courses by Prof. Yastrebov.

![Contact model discussed in first step](figures/Problem_mapping.png)

- Flat elastic[3] half-space with $E^*=\frac{E_1 E_2}{E_2\left(1-v_1^2\right)+E_1\left(1-v_2^2\right)}$
- Rough rigid[3] surface with $z^*=z_2-z_1$
- Optimization problem[4]: $\min \mathcal{F}$ 
  
  under constraints $p \geq 0$ and $\frac{1}{A_0} \int_A p d A=p_0$, 
  
  with $\mathcal{F}=\int_A p\left[u_z / 2+g\right] d A$
